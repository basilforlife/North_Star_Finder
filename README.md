# North_Star_Finder
Locate the north star in a photograph containing star trails

find_north_star.py is a script that takes an input image of a photograph containing star trails, and outputs the location of the north star in that photograph. It uses modified Sobel edge detection, modified cross products, and an optimizer to predict the location of the North Star. In its current state, the code quality is very poor.
